## Summary of Proposal
Devcon Agora : A place for talk related community discussions

We are proposing to build a decentralised platform where you can instantly share your thoughts, ask questions, and engage with fellow Devcon attendees. Weâ€™re building a web application to do just that.

## Abstract
By creating a vibrant online community centered around Devcon presentations, we can:
- Amplify speaker impact: Give speakers the recognition they deserve by fostering discussion around their work.
- Enhance attendee experience: Create opportunities for meaningful connections and knowledge sharing.
- Drive innovation: Spark new ideas and collaborations through open dialogue.

We believe this decentralised platform has the potential to transform the way we interact at conferences.

## Rationale
To provide a privacy-preserving communicatioon platform for Devcon participants to discuss talk related ideas, thoughts and suggestions.
